\title{\pkg{OpenRepGrid}: an R package for the analysis of repertory grids.}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right; padding-left: 10px;' alt='logo' width='120'}}
The \pkg{OpenRepGrid} package provides tools for the analysis of repertory grid data.
The repertory grid is a method devised by George Alexander Kelly
in his seminal work "The Psychology of Personal Constructs" published in 1955.
The repertory grid has been used in and outside the context of Personal Construct 
Psychology (PCP) in a broad range of fields. For an introduction into the 
technique see e.g. Fransella, Bell and Bannister (2003).
